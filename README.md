Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Muhammed Enes Demirel. I am 19 years old, and I am going to study Math and Computer Science major in DePaul University this fall. I have been coding since 9th grade, so you can find my old projects from that time, my current projects and some future school related things in this profile.
